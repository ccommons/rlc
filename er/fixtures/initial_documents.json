In addition, it has raised a number of new questions: what are the mechanisms of both inherent and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors and the possible ways to overcome this resistance; how is the activating effect of BRAF inhibition on the MAPK pathway in cells with nonmutated BRAF avoided; how should melanoma tumors that have no activating mutations in BRAF, such as tumors with mutated NRAS or tumors that are wild type for both BRAF and NRAS, be targeted; which targeted or nontargeted drug combinations should be pursued as determined by the molecular profile of each and every tumor; what is the future of combination targeted therapy and immunotherapy; and many more.</p>\n<p>The mutational landscape of melanoma was examined in several large studies employing NGS (next-generation sequencing) and large-scale expression analyses of tumors. The mutation rate of melanoma exceeds those reported for other aggressive tumors, probably due to the heavy involvement of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the genesis of superficial cutaneous melanomas. Indeed, the rate of transversions characteristic of UV-induced lesions is much higher in melanoma than the rates of other nucleotide substitutions. The high rate of mutations in melanoma makes it particularly difficult to distinguish between causative (\"driver\") mutations and bystander (\"passenger\") mutations.</p>\n<p>In one recent study[1], a wide range of point mutation rates was observed: mutation rates were lowest in melanomas in which primaries arose on non-ultraviolet-exposed hairless skin of the extremities (3 - 14 mutations per megabase [Mb] of genome); intermediate in those originating from hair-bearing skin of the trunk (5-55 per Mb); and highest in a patient with a documented history of chronic sun exposure (111 mutations per Mb). Uveal melanomas, tumors with generally poor prognosis, nevertheless have a fairly low mutation rate [2].</p>\n<p>The different types of melanoma appear to have distinct sets of relevant somatogenic alterations (Table 1 and 2). Some of the difference could be attributed to the lack of UV involvement in pathogenesis of acral and mucosal melanomas, and other could be due to different cellular lineages involved. Uveal melanoma was recognized asdistinct tumor for a long time, and it is reflected in predominance of driver mutations in G protein subunits rather then BRAF or NRAS mutations. Mutational analyses of mucosal melanoma concluded that this subtype shares with cutaneous melanoma relatively few mutations in specific genes, suggesting different mechanisms of carcinogenesis [3].The rare conjuctival melanoma apparently has a mutational landscape similar to cutaneous melanoma [4] , pending confirmation from an analysis of a larger number of tumors.</p>\n<p>This paper describes genetic alterations that are known to occur in melanoma and information about their role in melanomagenesis, as well as their suitability as targets for therapeutic intervention. The latest information on molecular events underlying inherent or acquired resistance to targeted therapies is also included, along with immunotherapeutic approaches and prognostic methodologies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"erh-1185313b-8376-46eb-81e4-e4b91afaff40\">Molecular subtypes</h2>\n<p>Multiple cellular pathways have been implicated in melanomagenesis, ranging from signal transduction to developmental and transcriptional pathways and cell cycle deregulation (Table 1). The search for driver mutations in melanoma continues, with the previously identified subtypes involving BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, and GNA11 expanded just recently to include NF1 and telomerase (Table 2). Together, these driver mutations are very likely to define the vast majority of molecular subtypes in melanoma and, eventually, the identified mutations in drivers will be guiding targeted therapy choices. However, for a number of reasons, such as oncogene-induced senescence (OIS, discussed below), driver mutations result in a frank tumorigenic phenotype only in the presence of \"supporting mutations\" that are also listed in Table 2 and described below. It is clear now that these supporting mutations have to be targeted along with driver mutations to achieve durable responses. Finally, immunotherapies continue to play an important role in melanoma treatment strategies and are also described here.</p>\n<h3>Table 1.

In support of this notion, while BRAF mutations are present in both nevi and melanoma sections of contiguous nevi-melanoma biopsies, activation of PI3K (through loss of PTEN expression or activation of AKT3) was detected in the melanoma portions only [1]. This indicates that the AKT3/PI3K pathway is activated during progression to malignant melanoma, possibly serving to overcome OIS. PI3K pathway activation serves as a rate-limiting event and dual inhibition of PI3K/mutant BRAF eliminated cells resistant to BRAF inhibition in vitro [2]. Several mutations in different components of the PI3K pathway, from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) to PTEN and to AKT3 have been described.</p>\n<p><strong>ERBB4.</strong> Mutations in this tyrosine kinase receptor are found in 19% of melanomas, based on the results of targeted sequencing of the tyrosine kinase family in seven melanoma tumors [3]. These might respond to lapatinib, which is currently in a clinical trial for advanced melanoma (NCT01264081).</p>\n<p><strong>MET.</strong> Mutations in MET have not been described in melanoma, but there is strong evidence that this RTK is involved in melanoma growth and metastases (see below: WNT pathway and HGF expression in stroma). Copy number gains involving MET locus in melanomas were documented [4]. SU11274, an inhibitor of MET, has shown significant activity in a xenograft model [5]. Cabozantinib, an inhibitor of MET and other RTKs is in clinical trials for a variety of cancers with deregulated RTK signaling. In melanoma, cabozantinib will be trialed in combination with vemurafenib (NCT01835184).</p>\n<p><strong>MERTK.</strong> MER (MERTK), a receptor tyrosine kinase sharing a family relationship with TYRO3 and AXL, was found to be expressed at increasing levels during progression from nevi to metastatic melanoma. Stimulation of MER with its ligand GAS6 leads to activation of MAPK, PI3K and JAK/STAT pathways. Inhibition of MERTK with a synthetic compound UNC1062 inhibits invasion and induces apoptosis in melanoma cells in vitro [6] MERTK and AXL are expressed alternatively in melanoma. MERTK expressing melanoma cells are more proliferative that AXL expressing cells, though the latter are more invasive [7](Tworkoski et al., 2013).</p>\n<p><strong>AKT.</strong> Deregulated Akt3 activity was shown to promote development of malignant melanoma; amplifications of Akt3 were detected in melanoma [8]. Alterations of Akt1 and Akt2 are rare, but genetic gain of Akt3 is seen in 25% of melanoma. High activity of Akt3 promotes progression of BRAFV600E-positive nevi to melanoma [9]. A trial combining MK2206 (Akt inhibitor) in combination with AZD6244 (the MEK inhibitor selumetinib) is in progress (NCT01519427).</p>\n<p><strong>PTEN</strong> is a well-known tumor suppressor affected in 50% to 60% of melanomas, most commonly via allelic loss and focal deletions [10]; [11]; [12]; [13]. PTEN is also deregulated in melanoma via loss of ZEB2, a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) [14]. In addition, disruptions of MAGI2, a protein that associates with and stabilizes PTEN, occur in melanoma [15]. PTEN aberrations are often associated with the presence of BRAFV600E, and cooperate with mutant BRAF in a GEMM [16], most likely providing an OIS inhibitory function by activating the PI3K pathway. In this model, growth of melanoma could be inhibited by combined treatment with PD325901 (MEK inhibitor) and rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor). PTEN inactivating aberrations are not associated with NRAS mutations, perhaps because the latter lead to activation of PI3K in the absence of this pathway's mutations. PTEN mutations and copy losses are associated with lower PFS in response to inhibition of mutant BRAF in patients[17].</p>\n<p><strong>Other PI3K pathway mutations.</strong> Mutations in other PI3K pathways genes MTOR, IRS4, PIK3R1, PIK3R4, and PIK3R5 were detected in 17% of BRAFV600 and in 9% of NRAS-mutant tumors [18]. It will be interesting to determine the status of these genes in melanoma tumors that show inherent or acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.</p>\n<h4>MAPK pathway downstream of BRAF</h4>\n<p><strong>MEK1 and MEK2.</strong> Sequencing of seven melanoma cell lines and donor-matched germline cells found MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 (MEK1 and MEK2, respectively) mutations, resulting in constitutive ERK phosphorylation and higher resistance to MEK inhibitors. Screening of a larger cohort of melanoma tumors revealed the presence of recurring somatic MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 mutations at an overall frequency of 8% [19].</p>\n<p><strong>IQGAP1: a scaffold protein in MAPK pathway as a possible target.</strong> There are new data indicating that it might be possible to target the MAPK pathway without direct inhibition of enzymatic activity of kinases in this pathway. It is well known that kinases usually depend on scaffold proteins that assemble signaling complexes. One of this scaffold proteins, IQGAP1 is essential for activity of ERK1/2, and disruption of IQGAP interaction with ERK using a small peptide inhibited RAS or BRAF driven tumorigenesis and even overcame resistance to Vemurafenib [20].</p>\n<p><strong>RAC pathway.</strong> RAC1 is a Rho GTPase, a GTP exchange protein known to affect the cell cytoskeleton and motility. Its role in conveying oncogenic signaling from mutant NRAS in melanoma was described [21] and references therein). Recently P29S mutations in the conserved switch domain were described in melanoma, in 5% of tumors in the experimental set [22]; [23], and their functional role in vitro was confirmed. Mutations were also found in other Rho family members: RAC2 (P29L), RHOT1 (P30L), and in CDC42 (G12D).</p>\n<p><strong>MAP3K5 and MAP3K9.</strong> These MAP3 kinases are directly downstream of Rac and Rho signaling activated by various stress signals. Mutations and the loss of heterozygosity of MAP3K5 and MAP3K9 in 85% and 67% of melanoma samples, respectively, suggest inactivation of these kinases. Indeed, mutants MAP3K5 I780F and MAP3K9 W333* variants had reduced kinase activity in vitro. Overexpression of these mutants reduced the phosphorylation of downstream MAP kinases, while siRNA-mediated depletion of MAP3K9 in melanoma cells led to increased cell viability after temozolomide treatment, suggesting that decreased MAP3K activity acts as a pro-survival adaptation [24].</p>\n<p><strong>PREX2.</strong> Mutations of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2 were found in 14% of a cohort of 107 tumors [25]. Functional studies in vitro have confirmed a role for PREX2 in melanomagenesis. Presence of mutations in three functional components of RAC pathways (RHO family proteins, MAP3K5 and MAP3K9, PREX2) strongly indicates involvement of RAC pathway in pathogenesis of melanoma.</p>\n<h4>Cell cycle and apoptosis related genes</h4>\n<p><strong>CDK4</strong>, a cell cycle G1/S kinase, and Cyclin D1 (CCND1) were shown to be amplified in melanoma [26]. In a clinical study of FOLFIRI (chemotherapeutic agent) with the nonselective CDK inhibitor flavopirodol in solid tumors, one melanoma patient had a complete response [27]. Targeted CDK inhibitors are in clinical development (PD0332991, Dinaciclib, LY2835219, BAY1000394, LEE011), and at least four of them are currently tested in trials for melanoma and other tumors (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).</p>\n<p><strong>TP53 pathway.</strong> TP53 mutations are rare in melanoma, raising the possibility that this cancer uses alternative ways to overcome p53-mediated tumor suppression. Indeed, several alterations in genes affecting p53 activity have been discovered in melanoma. Among them are: the long known mutations in p14ARF [28], overexpression of MDM2 [29], frequent amplification of MDM4 in melanoma [30], elevated expression and the anti-apoptotic role of p53 related protein p63 [31] and increased expression of iASPP [32](Bergamaschi et al., 2006) that all lead to the inhibition of p53. This means that the rare \u201c\"p53 mutant subtype\u201d\" could be now expanded to a \"\"p53 pathway aberrations\"\" subtype.</p>\n<p><strong>CDKN2A</strong> locus is frequently deleted in melanoma of all primary subtypes [33]; [34]; [35]. Two tumor suppressors are encoded within this locus: p14ARF, which activates p53 through inhibition of its major negative regulator MDM2; and p16INK4a, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that activates retinoblastoma (RB) through negative regulation of CDK4. Loss of CDKN2A was reported to occur in 16% to 41% of sporadic melanoma and with a high frequency in familial melanoma [36].</p>\n<p>Potential treatment of ARF deficiency would involve inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction. This interaction has attracted serious efforts to develop specific inhibitors, of which Nutlin analogues are the more advanced. The new generations of Nutlin-based drugs are in clinical studies for various solid tumors. Encouraging results were reported for one of them, RG7112, in early clinical testing for liposarcoma and other tumors [37]</p>\n<p>Nutlin-3, an early prototype inhibitor of TP53-MDM2 interaction was shown to synergize with vemurafenib in inducing cell death in melanoma cell lines and inhibiting tumor growth in vivo [38](Ji et al., 2013).</p>\n<p><strong>MDM4.</strong> In a recent study it was shown that MDM4, a negative regulator of p53, is upregulated in about 65% of melanomas, and that melanocyte-specific Mdm4 overexpression enhanced tumorigenesis in a mouse model of melanoma induced by Nras [39]. Inhibition of the MDM4-p53 interaction restored p53 function in melanoma cells, resulting in increased sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy and to inhibitors of the BRAFV600E. MDM4 could be a key determinant of impaired p53 function in human melanoma and a promising target for anti-melanoma combination therapy [40].</p>\n<p><strong>P63</strong>, a protein related to p53, has been reported to have an anti-apoptotic role in melanoma, which is mediated through its interaction with p53. P63 is expressed at high levels in melanoma cell lines and clinical samples and prevents translocation of p53 to the nucleus [41]. This study further expands the role of the aberrations of the p53 pathway in melanomagenesis.</p>\n<p><strong>iASPP</strong> is a conserved ankyrin repeat protein that shuttles between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, and nuclear iASPP is found in proliferating cells. The nuclear iASPP was shown to inhibit the pro-apoptotic function of p53 [42]. High levels of nuclear iASPP were observed in metastatic melanoma versus primary melanoma Lu and Breyssens. The authors found that iASPP is phosphorylated by cyclinB/CDK1 which promotes its nuclear localization, and binding to p53, inhibiting its pro-apoptotic function. Prevention of iASPP phosphorylation by CDK1 inhibitor or knock-down of iASPP induced apoptotic death in melanoma cell lines which is further enhanced by Nutlin3 (inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction and degradation of p53). Furthermore, inhibition of BRAF with vemurafenib, or MEK with UO126, potentiated effects of Nutlin3 and cyclinB/CDK1 inhibition, inducing apoptosis of melanoma in vitro and in vivo [43]. These findings indicate an alternative strategy for combining therapies targeting MAPK pathway and cyclinB/CDK1 in wild-type p53 melanoma.</p>\n<p><strong>NFkB.</strong> As in many, many other tumors, the NFkB pathway is activated in melanoma, but systemic inhibition of NFkB might have catastrophic general adverse effects/toxicity. A new faucet of NFkB activation was described recently in drug-treated melanoma cells that might acquire a senescent secretory phenotype; the latter results in a pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic phenotype characterized by production of CCL-2. Activated NFkB and PARP-1 contribute to this phenomenon and could be involved in the therapeutic failure [44].</p>\n<p><strong>BCL2.</strong> There is abundant literature that documents elevated BCL2 expression in melanoma and its contribution to melanoma and melanocyte cell survival. A member of this family, BCL2A1, was shown to be amplified in 30% of melanoma and contribute to resistance to BRAF inhibition [45] (see under \u201cIntrinsic resistance\u201d).</p>\n<p>BCL2A1 is a direct transcriptional target of MITF, and is highly expressed in melanomas with high MITF levels.</p>\n<p>Attempts to target BCL2 with antisense RNA in melanoma patients have not been successful. Obatoclax, a drug inhibiting interaction of BCL2 with proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak is in clinical trials for other malignancies. BH3 mimetics to inhibit function of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BCL2 and BCL-xL, are still subjects of significant interest. One of them, ABT-737 resensitized both melanoma cell lines in vitro and tumors in the in vivo model to common chemotherapeutics (including the only FDA-approved chemotherapeutic for melanoma: dacarbazine), leading to marked BIM (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death) -mediated apoptosis. ABT-737 may be a beneficial adjuvant therapy to improve Melanoma Response rates when conventional chemotherapy is the only option [46].</p>\n<h4>\u03b2-catenin and WNT pathway</h4>\n<p>A number of reports have heavily implicated WNT signaling in melanoma progression and metastases. \u03b2-catenin fortifies the cadherin-based adhesion at the plasma membrane, but, when detached from cadherins, activates transcription of target genes, frequently with oncogenic consequences. Rare mutations in b-catenin and in other members of the WNT signaling family were identified in malignant melanoma 10 years ago [47]. b-catenin suppresses expression of p16INK and cooperates with NRAS in transformation to a frank melanoma [48]WNT5a, in particular, by binding to the Frizzled4- LRP6 complex activates ARF6 (guanosine triphosphatase adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 6), leading to displacement of \u03b2-catenin from N-cadherin in melanoma. This stimulates signaling from \u03b2-catenin and increases invasiveness [49].</p>\n<p>In a mouse melanoma model based on PTEN loss and BRAFV600E mutation, b-catenin was shown to be a central mediator of metastases as well as a regulator of both MAPK and PI3K pathways. Recent findings established Wnt signaling as a metastasis regulator in melanoma [50]. Mutant BRAF signaling is thought to inhibit WNT/b-catenin signaling. Endogenous b-catenin was apparently required for the efficacy of PLX4720 in vitro; activation of WNT/b-catenin signaling was found to enhance the anticancer activity of PLX4720 in vitro and in vivo [51].</p>\n<p>Negative regulation of WNT/b-catenin signaling by MAPK pathway was confirmed in an additional study [52]. Treatment of BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant melanoma lines with WNT3A and the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 induces apoptosis. The susceptibility of BRAF- and NRAS-mutant lines to apoptosis correlated with negative regulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling by ERK/MAPK signaling and dynamic decreases in abundance of the downstream scaffolding protein, AXIN1 [53]. WNT inhibitors such as PRI-724 (inhibitor of interaction between b-catenin and CBP) and OMP-54F28 (a fusion protein antagonistic to Fzd8) are starting to enter clinical testing in tumors other than melanoma.</p>\n<h4>Transcriptional factors in melanoma</h4>\n<p><strong>MYC.</strong> This universal oncogene and transcriptional master regulator is overexpressed or present at increased copy numbers in 41% or more of melanoma tumors [54]. It is currently considered not to be druggable.</p>\n<p><strong>ETV1.</strong> This transcription factor from the ETS family was implicated as an oncogene in melanoma and copy gain numbers were found in 40% of cases examined, with amplification of ETV1 in 13% to18% of cases [55].</p>\n<h4>Other significant genetic abnormalities in melanoma</h4>\n<p><strong>NEDD9</strong>, an integrin adaptor protein related to P130CAS, and a member of a family implicated in pathogenesis of a variety of cancers, was identified as a bona fide melanoma metastasis gene in melanoma. NEDD9 enhanced invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo of both normal and transformed melanocytes, and was frequently overexpressed in metastatic melanoma relative to primary melanoma [56]. Fifty-seven percent of melanomas were found to have amplification of NEDD9 [57].</p>\n<p><strong>PPP6C</strong> is a serine-threonine phosphatase, mutated in 12% of sun-exposed melanomas exclusively with BRAF or NRAS mutations [58]; [59]. PPP6C is the catalytic unit of a phosphatase complex that negatively regulates activity of the mitotic Aurora kinase, a known oncogene. Most mutations map in the conserved domain involved in the interaction with the regulatory subunit of the complex.</p>\n<p><strong>TACC1</strong> (transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 1) is mutated in 5% of an experimental set of 121. TACC1 is known to stimulate the PI3K and Ras pathways and interact with Aurora kinase, which is notable considering that PPP6C mutations that inactivate Aurora kinase (above). [60]. At least 16 Aurora kinase inhibitors are in clinical studies, of which two (MLN8237/alisertib, GSK1070916A) are investigated melanoma (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).</p>\n<p><strong>BAP1</strong> (BRCA1-associated protein-1/ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase) is involved in metastatic progression of ocular and cutaneous melanoma. BAP1 is a known tumor suppressor gene. BAP1 mutations are frequently found in uveal melanoma [61]. Germline BAP1 mutations have recently been associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including atypical melanocytic tumors [62] and uveal melanoma [63]. Uveal melanoma might be sensitive to HDAC inhibitors [64].</p>\n<p><strong>SF3B1.</strong> Codon 625 of the SF3B1 gene, encoding splicing factor 3B subunit 1, is consistently mutated in low-grade uveal melanomas with good prognosis [65]. Mutations of SF3B1 are associated with disomy 3 (Martin et al., 2013), are mutually exclusive with BAP1 mutations and lead to aberrant splicing of transcripts of a number of genes [66](Furney et al., 2013a).</p>\n<p><strong>SNX31</strong> was identified as one of the 11 new genes mutated in melanoma [67]. It encodes a poorly characterized sorting nexin 31 protein. It could be a Ras effector protein that selectively binds GTP loaded H-RAS [68].</p>\n<p><strong>STK19.</strong> A five percent mutation rate of this kinase gene with unknown functions is seen in melanoma [69].</p>\n<p><strong>LKB1/STK11.</strong> LKB1 might be a central kinase that integrates energy metabolism and tumor growth, in part through activation of the family of AMPK kinases. Germline mutations in LKB1 (STK11) are associated with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which includes aberrant mucocutaneous pigmentation, and somatic LKB1 mutations, which occur in 10% of cutaneous melanoma [70]. Somatic inactivation of LKB1 with K-Ras activation in murine melanocytes led to highly metastatic melanoma with 100% penetrance. Downstream events of LKB1 inactivation, in addition to AMPK-related effects, included increased phosphorylation of the SRC family kinase YES, increased expression of WNT target genes, and expansion of a CD24(+) cell population in melanoma with increased metastatic behavior in vitro and in vivo [71]. Dasatinib, an SRC inhibitor, was shown previously to exhibit a higher activity towards YES rather than SRC, and could be a promising treatment for LKB1-mutated melanoma [72]. Metformin, an indirect activator of AMPK, the downstream target of LKB1, is currently in a clinical trial in combination with vemurafenib (NCT01638676).</p>\n<p><strong>ARID2</strong> is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Loss of function mutations were found in 7% of melanomas. Targeted search identified mutations in other members of the ARID family (ARID1B, ARID1A, SMARCA4), all together amounting to 13% of the experimental set [73].</p>\n<p><strong>TRRAP2.</strong> Identified mutations occur in 4% of the melanoma set examined. TRRAP functions as part of a multiprotein coactivator complex possessing histone acetyltranferase activity that is central to the transcriptional activity of p53, c-Myc, and E2F1 [74].</p>\n<p><strong>GRIN2A</strong> encodes the glutamate N-methyl-(D)-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor subunit \u03b5-1 that is part of the class of ionotropic glutamate receptors and bears the agonist binding site for glutamate. GRIN2A was found to be mutated in 25% of melanomas [75]; this was confirmed in another study [76]. Many mutations are missense or nonsense; therefore, it is unlikely to behave as a canonical oncogene.</p>\n<p><strong>GRM3</strong> is a metabotropic glutamate receptor, a GPCR that activates phospholipase C upon ligand binding. It was found to be mutated in melanoma through exome capture analysis of GPCR genes [77]. Mutated GRM3 was shown to contribute to the proliferation and invasiveness of melanoma cells in vitro and induce an increased phosphorylation of MEK. AZD-6244, an inhibitor of MEK, was able to reduce cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis in vitro. There is some interest in using available inhibitors of glutamate release for treatment of melanoma, since one of them, riluzole, was shown to inhibit growth of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo [78]. Even though riluzole was shown to inhibit growth of cell lines expressing GRM1, a clinical trial is ongoing to explore the antitumor activity of riluzole in melanoma without prior analysis of GRM3 status.</p>\n<p><strong>Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase PHGDH</strong> serves to divert glycolytic carbon into serine and glycine metabolism in some cancer cells to supply the increased biosynthetic needs of transformed phenotype [79]. The same study found that PHGDH is recurrently amplified in a genomic region of a focal copy number gain most commonly found in melanoma. Melanoma cell lines with amplified PHGDH had increased flux through the serine pathway. This pathway, as well as Melanoma cell lines with amplified PHGDH had increased flux through the serine pathway. This pathway, as well as proliferation of cells with high PHGDH, was sensitive to short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of PHGDH [80].</p>\n<p><strong>WEE1.</strong> Cell cycle regulatory kinase Wee1 is upregulated in melanoma and is associated with poor prognosis [81]. Selective inhibitor of Wee1 MK-1775 showed somewhat promising results as a single agent in previously treated patients with metastatic melanoma, but additional trials are not being conducted at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>NUAK2</strong> (AMPK-related kinase). High levels of expression of NUAK2 were found in patients with acral melanoma and are associated with increased risk of relapse [82]. NUAK2 knockdown suppresses melanoma cell growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo and has been proposed as a new oncogene in acral melanoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Exosomes</strong> are small membrane vesicles with an endosome origin that are released by cells into the extracellular environment. Tumor-derived exosomes are emerging mediators of tumorigenesis; there is a growing interest in exploring treatment options targeting exosomes. A recent exciting study analyzed exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas. It found that these \"metastatic\" exosomes increased the metastatic behavior of primary tumors by permanently \"educating\" bone marrow progenitors through the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also induced vascular leakiness at premetastatic sites and reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype. Reducing MET expression in exosomes diminished the prometastatic behavior of bone marrow cells. Notably, MET expression was elevated in circulating bone marrow progenitors from individuals with metastatic melanoma. The study identified an exosome-specific melanoma signature with prognostic and therapeutic potential comprised of TYRP2, VLA-4, HSP70 (HSP90) isoform, and the MET oncoprotein [83].</p>\n<h4>Various non-coding RNAs and other epigenetic alterations</h4>\n<p>A number of reports found significant roles for miRNA, ncRNA, or ceRNA in pathogenesis of melanoma; for example, ZEB2, a ceRNA for PTEN, upregulates expression of this tumor suppressor in melanoma. Abrogated ZEB2 cooperates with BRAFV600E to promote melanomagenesis. [84].</p>\n<p>ADAR1, a protein of the family known as adenosine deaminase acting on RNA, is substantially downregulated during metastatic progression of melanoma. ADAR1 was found to regulate expression of numerous miRNAs, as well as of the key miRNA processing protein DICER. Two miRNAS were implicated in silencing of ADAR1 itself (http://www.jci.org/articles/view/62980). These findings reaffirm the significant contribution of epigenetic miRNA regulation to melanoma pathogenesis.</p>\n<p>Strategies to inhibit or increase expression of ncRNAs in clinical setting are only beginning to emerge. A growing interest in epigenetic alterations such as chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, and histone modification regarding their role in melanomagenesis, might lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets (reviewed in van den Hurk, et al, 2012 [85].</p>\n<h2 id=\"erh-3982c4a6-311a-4ac4-a574-1f2017eea49c\">Intrinsic Resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors</h2>\n<p>Resistance to BRAF inhibitors could be intrinsic (as in lack of response to selective BRAF inhibitors in patients with BRAF-mutated tumors) or acquired (development of resistance after treatment with BRAF or MEK inhibitors). Both are of the utmost concern. The current understanding of the origins of intrinsic resistance, as well as possible approaches to overcoming it, are addressed below (and Table 3).</p>\n<p>BRAF mutations play a well-established role in melanomagenesis; however, without additional genetic alterations, tumor development is restricted by OIS. As listed above and in Table 1, additional genetic alterations are present in BRAF-mutant tumors, some of which serve to overcome OIS, and could play a role in inherent resistance to mutant BRAF and MEK inhibitors. These two groups overlap, as could be expected. The necessity of targeting multiple signaling pathways to overcome drug resistance of aggressive melanoma was demonstrated in vitro [1]. Genomic analyses and the informed choice of combinatorial approaches analyzed in preclinical models are critical in selecting the right combination of targeted therapies in a personalized approach to melanoma treatment. In general, in addition to the MAPK pathway that is deregulated in most melanomas, the other targets might include any of the ones listed in Table 1. Experimental evidence indicating involvement of several pathways/genes in the inherent resistance to BRAF inhibition is cited below.</p>\n<h3>Table 3.

These have been shown to overcome BRAVV600E-induced OIS and contribute to inherent resistance to BRAF inhibitors [17]. In particular, loss of PTEN and consequent loss of expression of the pro-apoptotic BIM that is regulated by PTEN were implicated in inherent resistance to BRAF inhibitor in vitro [18]. PTEN- or AKT3-overexpressing melanomas do not undergo apoptosis in response to BRAF inhibition and do not upregulate pro-apoptotic protein BIM. PLX4720 was found to stimulate AKT signaling in the PTEN-, but not the PTEN+, cell lines. A clinical trial with inhibitors of both MAPK and PI3K showed promise in patients with various solid tumors [19]. Recent study demonstrated an essential role for ERK-phosphorylated MEK1 (pT292) in membrane recruitment of PTEN and consequent negative regulation of AKT [20]. Inhibition of BRAFV600-MEK1-ERK therefore might lead to the inhibition of the restraining role that this pathway has on activity of PI3K/AKT pathway via PTEN.</p>\n<p><strong>CDK4 pathway.</strong> Increased cyclin D expression mediates inherent resistance to mutant BRAF inhibition [21].</p>\n<p><strong>NF1 mutations.</strong> In a mouse model, NF1 ablation decreases the sensitivity of NF1 wild-type melanoma cell lines to BRAF inhibitors, and NF1 is lost in tumors from patients following treatment with these agents. Nf1/BRAF-mutant tumors are resistant to BRAF inhibitors, but are sensitive to combined MEK/mTOR inhibition [22]. In another study, NF1 mutations were documented in BRAF-mutant tumor cells that were intrinsically resistant to BRAF inhibition, and in melanoma tumors obtained from patients exhibiting resistance to vemurafenib, thus demonstrating the clinical significance for NF1-driven resistance to RAF/MEK-targeted therapies[23].</p>\n<p><strong>MET and SRC</strong>. The activation of MET and SRC signaling was detected in two patient-derived melanoma cell lines with BRAFV600E that were resistant to BRAF inhibitor PLX4032. MET or SRC, respectively, was targeted with siRNA or drugs in combination with PLX4032. This was effective in inhibiting cell growth and reducing cell invasion and migration, indicating a functional role for MET and SRC signaling in primary resistance to PLX4032 [24].</p>\n<p><strong>Metabolic signature of melanoma sensitive to mutant BRAF inhibition.</strong> An interesting study could not find correlation between sensitivity to PLX4032 and genetic profiles in a panel of BRAF-mutant cell lines. However, the sensitive cell lines had a more profound inhibition of FDG uptake upon exposure to PLX4032 than resistant cell lines. This indicates that melanoma with a higher dependence on glycolysis might be more sensitive to mutant BRAF inhibition. This also indicates that FDG-PET could be useful in assessing sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors [25]. Indeed, a clinical study that incorporated FDG-PET monitoring of responses to vemurafenib strongly indicated that there is a positive correlation between responses to therapy (PFS) and reduction in the uptake of FDG [26].</p>\n<p><strong>MITF-PGC1a</strong> axis in resistance to BRAF inhibition. Inhibition of BRAFV600 and, to a lesser extent, of MEK were found to induce expression of genes involved in citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in melanoma. Search for factors regulating OXPHOS revealed that PGC1a is upregulated in resistant melanoma lines [27]. PGC1a, in turn, was found to be a direct transcriptional target of MITF [28][29]. MITF expression and, as a consequence, PGC1a levels are upregulated in melanoma lines and in tumors of patients treated with Vemurafenib. Inhibition of BRAF leads to inhibition of glycolytic pathway for ATP production, but MITF-expressing melanomas can undergo a bioenergetics adaptation via MITF-PGC1a-OXPHOS upregulation [30]. The authors suggest targeting OXPHOS in this group of patients prior to use of MAPK inhibitors, because lines selected to resistance to Vemurafenib have elevated levels of PGC1a.</p>\n<p><strong>Tumor stroma influence.</strong> An important study demonstrated production of HGF by stromal cells in patients with melanoma, which resulted in activation of the HGF receptor MET, reactivation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways, and resistance to BRAF. High production of HGF was observed in the stroma samples from patients who had a poor response to the inhibition of mutant BRAF. In a cellular model, cotreatment with BRAF and HGF or MET inhibitors reversed drug resistance[31].</p>\n<p><strong>BCL-2.</strong> Inhibition of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 might have a potential role in the future studies aimed to prevent the development of resistance to BRAF inhibition. The BH3 mimetic ABT-737 (inhibiting both Bcl2 and Bcl-xL) sensitizes human melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by selective BRAF inhibitors, but does not reverse acquired resistance in vitro [32].</p>\n<p><strong>BCL2A1.</strong> Amplification of one family member, BCL2A1 in 30% of melanoma was shown to contribute to resistance to BRAF inhibition [33]. BCL2A1 expression is apparently restricted to melanocytic lineage as it is indirectly controlled by MITF, and because of this its expression is limited to high MITF expressing melanomas. Obatoclax, inhibitor of BCL family, helps to overcome the resistance of cell lines with amplified BCL2A1 to BRAF inhibition.</p>\n<p><strong>FOXD3-ERBB3.</strong> Transcription factor FOXD3 was shown to be upregulated when mutant BRAF is inhibited in melanoma cell lines PGC1a [34]. Subsequent work revealed that FOXD3 directly activates expression of ERBB3 that contributes to resistance to Vemurafenib via activation of PI3K pathway, with involvement of ERBB2. The latter finding indicates a possibility of targeting ERBB2 alongside BRAF to overcome resistance [35].</p>\n<p><strong>Chaperone Hsp90</strong> is required for the stability of several of the oncoproteins that mediate RAF inhibitor resistance. Inhibitors of Hsp90 may be effective in patients with intrinsic or acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition [36] . In lab studies, treatment of melanoma cells with XL888, the inhibitor of Hsp90, induced apoptosis more effectively than dual MEK/PI3K inhibition in several different models of resistance [37] . Multiple proteins including PDGFR\u03b2, COT, IGFR1, CRAF, ARAF, S6, cyclin D1, and AKT were degraded as a result of inhibition of Hsp90, which led to the nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a, an increase in BIM expression, and the downregulation of Mcl-1. XL888 is now in clinical studies in combination with vemurafenib (NCT01657591). XL888 was also effective against NRAS mutant melanoma cells in vitro and in xenografts, most likely by decreasing protein levels of AKT, CDK4 and WEE1. [38] Another non-geldanamycin Hsp90 inhibitor, STA-9090 (ganetispib), is also in clinical trials.</p>\n<p><strong>mTORC1 activity.</strong> Activity of mTORC1 after treatment of melanoma cells in vitro was found to be a faithful predictor of the response. Suppression of mTORC1 as seen from inhibited phosphorylation of the surrogate marker ribosomal s6 protein was highly predictive of death response to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. In patients, suppression of phospho-S6 was significantly associated with improved PFS [39]{Corcoran, 2013 #323}. Quantitation of p-S6 could serve as a biomarker to guide treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma. It also raises the possibility that simultaneous inhibition of mutant BRAF or MEK and mTORC1 might be of clinical value. Several early phase clinical trials examining MEK inhibitors with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are recruiting patients.</p>\n<h2 id=\"erh-40a998df-4570-41ba-8be7-4b44ee1eac04\">Acquired Resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors</h2>\n<p>Mechanistic studies have provided insights into the development of resistance that could be acquired by two different mechanisms: new mutations in the RAF-MAPK pathway itself or changes in other oncogenic pathways that relieve melanoma cells from reliance on BRAF signaling [1]</p>\n<p>The identification of mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors usually involves selection of surviving cells/clones from BRAF-mutant cells lines in vitro after treatment with a BRAF inhibitor and identification of newly acquired mutations or other somatic changes. Biopsies from relapsed patients are then analyzed for the prespence of these in vitro-identified changes. Alternatively, biopsies are subjected to massive sequencing for identification of newly acquired mutations/aberrations. A clinical study that examined mechanisms of developing resistance to Vemurafenib concluded that it resulted mainly form re-activation of MAPK signaling [2]. Based on findings described below, it appears that many of the confirmed mechanisms of resistance are indeed in this category, though activation of pathways \u201cparallel\u201d to BRAF-MAPK has been documented (Table 4).</p>\n<h3>Table 4.

Recent results of clinical studies combining two targeted therapies have confirmed the long held belief that combinatorial approaches have significant advantages over monotherapy [1]; [2].</p>\n<p>Two recent publications examined possible synergistic interactions between targeted therapies. The first study [3] looked at synthetic lethal pairwise interactions of a library of 300 compounds in a panel of nine established melanoma cell lines. This study did not find synergistic interactions that were genotype genotype-specific (BRAF, NRAS- mutant or wild wild-type cell lines were screened). A synergistic interaction was found for just one combination, which was not genotype-related: of sorafenib and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, which was not genotype--related. . Drug substitution experiments confirmed that the synergy is due to the combined effects on MAPK and cyclooxygenase (COX).</p>\n<p>The second study [4] examined drug interactions between 150 small molecule inhibitors in a panel of 28 early passage cell lines from melanomas with mutations either in BRAF, NRAS, or neither. This study produced results different from those of the first study, perhaps due to the choice of early passage lines versus established ones. The authors first selected inhibitors that showed some activity in at least one group of lines, and proceeded to analyze the anti-proliferative effects of all drugs pairwise (over 7,000 combinations). The single drug screen produced several drugs with activity in BRAF BRAF-mutant melanoma, some of them known (vemurafenib and MEK inhibitors), but also non-BRAF BRAF-targeted kinase inhibitors of SRC/ABL (bosutinib), FGFR (dovitinib), and EGFR (gefitinib). There were almost no drugs effective against NRAS NRAS-mutant lines, except 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor (HMGCR) simvastatin, which indirectly blocked prenylation and membrane localization of RAS. Drug combination analysis showed that the most effective combination for BRAF mutantBRAF-mutant lines was that of vemurafenib, EGFR, and AKT inhibitors, that which was cytotoxic even in lines with primary resistance to vemurafenib or in lines selected for resistance to vemurafenib. NRAS mutantNRAS-mutant lines were most sensitive to combination of the HMGCR inhibitor simvastatin and a non-specific CDK inhibitor flavopiridol which was in line with the previous studies highlighting the role of CDK activation in pathogenesis of NRAS driven melanoma [5]. Simvastatin was able to displace NRAS from the plasma membrane, thus exhibiting an inhibitory effect on its activity.These findings could be important in guiding the future preclinical and clinical studies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"erh-027b576c-23d6-4124-80af-058df401e802\">Immunotherapy</h2>\n<p>Melanoma is considered to be highly immunogenic and responsive to immunotherapy. In addition to IL-2 approval in 1998, pegylated interferon-\u03b12b as an adjuvant therapy and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) as therapy for advanced disease were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for melanoma in March 2011. The response rates to either are not impressive, but responses to IL-2 and antibodies to CTLA-4 and PD-1 are typically long-lasting. In recent years, investigational agents have included adoptive T cell transfer, blocking antibodies against inhibitory immune molecules, stimulatory antibodies for immune cells, and immunization with cancer cell antigens. A rapidly developing field is the identification and validation of biomarkers predictive of responses to immunotherapy (reviewed in [1]). These might include a variety of tumor and tumor microenvironment specific alterations, and possibly the individual immune parameters of a patient. The mutational load of a tumor could be also a predictive factor, as it is plausible that highly mutated tumors are more immunogenic, therefore triggering a more robust immune response.</p>\n<h3>Immunomodulatory antibodies</h3>\n<p>The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (antibodies that block proteins inhibiting immune response) has gained particular interest after approval of ipilimumab/anti-CTLA4 antibody for treatment of melanoma in 2011, and more so after the recent reports on the clinical efficacy of antibodies blocking PD-1. Table 5 shows some of the clinical trials with the immune system targeting antibodies which are described below.</p>\n<h3>Table 5.

on T cells that is involved in the negative regulation of the T cell interaction with antigen presenting dendritic cells (APCs). CTLA4 inhibits binding of CD28 on T cells to B7 proteins on APCs, thus weakening the costimulation of T cells. CTLA4 is also expressed on tumor cell lines [2] and in human melanoma [3]; blockade of CTLA4 in vitro induces apoptosis of melanoma cells, indicating that CTLA4 might have nonimmune functions. Available results from clinical trials indicate that the response rates to CTLA4 blockade with human monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab and tremelimumab are, at most, at 18%, but responses to IL-2 and CTLA4 are typically long-lasting. Significant autoimmune toxicities were reported in a number of trials, and, interestingly, strong association of immune-related toxicities and responses were observed (reviewed in [4] ; [5]).</p>\n<p>Potential markers that could predict response to ipilimumab are of obvious importance. Clinical trial NCT00261365 incorporated investigation of a number of parameters in tumor biopsies pre- and post-treatment with ipilimumab. Significant associations were detected between clinical activity and high-baseline expression of FoxP3 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and the increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) [6]. Preclinical studies in B16 murine melanoma model have demonstrated the immunosuppressive role of IDO in the context of immunotherapies [7] .</p>\n<p>Trials of ipilimumab and gp100 peptide vaccine, each as a single agent or in combination, showed limited responses, but the responses were long lasting. Early phase combination trials with ipilimumab include the following second agents: bevacizumab, high doze interferon a-2b, IL-2, GM-CSF, anti-PD-1 antibody (see below), antibody to NK receptor KIR BMS-986015 (in patients with melanoma or other tumors, an d even an oncolytic herpes simplex 1 virus (talimogene laherparepvec) designed to replicate selectively in tumor cells and to express GM-CSF (the virus preparation is injectable directly into tumors), as well as a variety of chemotherapeutic agents and surgical/radiotherapy interventions (Supplementary Table 2). Reported results from trial NCT01134614 combining ipilimumab with GM-CSF showed am increased OS in the combination arm (ASCO abstract # CRA9007, 2013). Trial of T-VEC has also produced encouraging results (ASCO 2013 abstract LBA9008).</p>\n<p><strong>PD-1</strong>, like CTLA-4, is an inhibitory receptor; however, its expression is not limited to T cells and is found in B cells and some myeloid cells. PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, have different expression patterns, with PD-L1 found on multiple normal and cancerous cells including melanoma tumors, where it provides, once bound by PD-1, peripheral tolerance to \"self\" antigens [8]. PD-L2 is expressed on APC cells, providing tolerance to orally administered antigens. Interactions between PD-1 and its ligands attenuate immune responses [9], and, in the context of cancer, serve to protect tumor cells from cytotoxic T cells. At the same time, PD-1 is expressed on CD8+ T cells in patients with metastatic melanoma, which suggests that the immune response to melanoma is inhibited under these circumstances.</p>\n<p>Humanized antibodies to PD-1 and PD-L1 have been developed and tested in clinical trials for several cancers including melanoma. Anti-PD1 antibody nivolumab was well tolerated and the maximum tolerated dose has not been reached [10]. This study also found a strong correlation between pretreatment tumor expression of PD-L1 and responses, with a 36% responses rate in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1, and 0% in PD-L1 \u2013 negative group. These findings highlighted the importance of the identification of predictive markers in the future design of immunotherapy trials. The better safety profile of PD-1 antibody versus CTLA-4 antibody is most likely due to the fact that the latter targets a peripheral interaction between T cells and APCs. Inhibition of PD-1 probably inhibits peripheral interactions as well, through PD-L2 on APCs, but it could be expected to act more locally at tumor sites by preventing inhibition of tumor-infiltrating PD-1 expressing T cells through interaction with PD-L1 on tumor cells. Anti-PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280A/BMS-936559/MDX-1105 was also tested in several cancers, including melanoma, and objective responses were observed in 9 of 52 melanoma patients; the responses were durable [11].</p>\n<h3>Clinical trials targeting PD-1/ PD-L1 interaction</h3>\n<p>Results from an early-phase clinical trial with anti-PD1 antibody BMS-936558 (MDX-1106, nivolumab: Brystol-Myers Squibb) showed durable responses in 28% of patients with melanoma, among others [12]. It was noted that expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells was a strong predictive marker of response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Currently there are eight trials ongoing with MDX-1106 for melanoma.</p>\n<p>Two other anti-PD-1 antibodies (CT-011: CureTech Ltd.; MK-3475/Lambrolizumab: Merck) are also in clinical trials. Results of a clinical trial of Lambrolizumab in advanced melanoma produced very promising results. Of 135 patients treated, 38% had durable responses as evaluated by RECIST. Remarkably, patients that have received ipilimumab prior to enrolling in this trial had a similar response rate. Importantly, Lambrolizumab showed a great safety profile [13].</p>\n<p>An anti-PD-L1 (MPDL3280A/BMS-936559: Bristol-Myers Squibb) is being tested as well.Preliminary results with anti-PD-L1 antibody showedsignificant tumor shrinkage in 21 percent of 140 patients who had a variety of cancers including lung, melanoma and kidney cancer.</p>\n<p>Anti-PD-1/nivolumab/MK-3475 and anti-CTLA-4/Yervoy antibodies are being trialed together with the hope of synergistic effects (NCT01024231). This combination treatment, when administered concurrently, produced clinical responses in 65% of patients, and objective responses in 53%. The observed tumor shrinkage was more than 80% for most of responding patients. In several patients in the study, tumors disappeared completely, as could be determined by imaging. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to therapy occurred in 53% of patients, but were reversible[14]. A randomized phase III trial NCT01844505 with ipilimumab and nivolumab is recruiting patients; the endpoint is OS. Phase II trial NCT01783938 will explore sequential administration of nivolumab and ipilimumab.</p>\n<p>In general, a concept is emerging that different immune checkpoints might have non-overlapping functions in the immune escape, and therefor targeting more than one inhibitory molecule might be a general strategy for the future approaches to immunotherapies. In addition to CTLA and PD-1/PD-L1, other proteins (LAG-3 and TIM-3) act as checkpoints. In addition, several proteins listed below are known to positively modulate T cells function.</p>\n<p>Other targets for immunotherapy include several proteins that are involved in stimulating T cell responses; relevant therapies aim to elicit agonistic responses.</p>\n<p><strong>4-1BB.</strong> Also known as CD137, 4-1BB is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, and is an activation-induced costimulatory molecule. Binding of 4-1BB by its ligand or antibody induces powerful CD8+ T-cell activation, IFN-\u03b3 production, and cytolytic activity. An agonistic antibody, BMS-663513 (Bristol-Myers Squibb) was in clinical trials for melanoma and other tumors. Safety concerns caused suspension of the trial after several patients developed liver problems, including high-grade hepatitis. However, the antibody has a promise in expanding the repertoire of functional CD8+ effector cells during T cells expansion for autologous cell transfer (ACT). A recent study showed that addition of BMS-663513 to the expansion cultures of T cells isolated from metastases strongly increased the frequency and yield of CD8+ cells as well as their cytotoxic activity in vitro [15]</p>\n<p><strong>GITR</strong> is a costimulatory receptor expressed after T cell activation that enhances T cell function and survival. GITR also negatively affects regulatory T cells (Tregs), a specialized T-cell lineage that downregulates cellular immunity. A trial with anti-GITR antibody TRX-518 is ongoing.</p>\n<p><strong>OX40</strong> is not involved in effector T cell activation, but rather, promotes T cell survival and expansion. In a clinical study, based at the Portland Providence Medical Center in Oregon, patients received three infusions of the agonistic mouse anti-OX40 antibody within a week. The nature of the antibody precluded further treatments. Nine of 27 patients experienced minor tumor shrinkage, although none met RECIST (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors) criteria for objective responses.</p>\n<p><strong>CD40.</strong> Unlike the costimulatory targets above, CD40 is expressed on APCs, while its ligand is expressed on T cells. Binding of the two acts as a powerful enhancer of APCs\u2019 ability to present antigens and activate T cells against foreign targets [16]. A large number of cancer patients received infusions of agonistic antibody CP870,893 and some responses were observed. A surprising finding was that treatments did not increase numbers of TILs in the tumors. In a mouse model, antibody treatments induced an influx of macrophages into tumors, presumably with enhanced cytotoxic activities. A phase I trial NCT01103635 combining CP870,893 with tremelimumab in melanoma and other tumors is ongoing.</p>\n<p><strong>CEACAM1</strong> is a potential new target for the development of targeting antibodies. CEACAM1 is a carcinoembryonic, antigen-related adhesion molecule 1 from the IG superfamily whose expression is absent from normal melanocytes, but often found in melanomas, particularly those that are metastatic. CEACAM1 was shown to protect melanoma cells from T cells in vitro, and, moreover, its expression was found on T cells and NK cells from melanoma patients, presumably enabling a homotypic inhibitory interaction. A mouse antibody to CEACAM has no apparent effect on CEACAM1-expressing melanoma cells in vitro, but renders them susceptible to elimination by T cells in vitro and in an in vivo xenograft model. These findings provide a strong rationale for developing CEACAM1-based therapeutics for the treatment of metastatic melanoma [17].</p>\n<h3>Adoptive cell transfer</h3>\n<p>Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) involves the selection of autologous lymphocytes with antitumor activity, their expansion/activation ex vivo, and their reinfusion into the patient, often in the context of lymphodepleting regimens to minimize endogenous immunosuppression (reviewed in Galluzzi, et al, 2007; Itzhaki, et al, 2013[18] ; [19]. ACT was and remains a subject of intense clinical interest in melanoma treatment. A number of clinical trials were completed and are ongoing, but no versions of ACT have been approved by the FDA so far. T cell adoptive therapy for metastatic melanoma has been quite successful in eradicating tumors in about 50% of patients [20]and produced durable complete regressions. The clinical application of T cell transfer are confounded by a number of issues, such as the availability of the sufficient freshly resected tumor material, specific HLA restriction, complex and variable expansion protocols, and stringent regulatory issues.</p>\n<p>Different aspects of ACT are being examined, among them the role of cytokines such as T cell-produced IL-9 in T cell-based therapy [21]; concomitant low-dose IL-2 in patients treated with ACT [22]; facilitation of the long-term engraftment of T cells by using the memory T cell population [23] ; [24]; the basis for the relapse frequently observed after ACT immunotherapy, such as inflammation-induced reversible loss of melanocytic antigens mediated by TNF-a [25]; the immunosuppressive role of Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) [26], the significance of the rare V\u03b41 T cells in recognition of tumor cell antigens [27]; and many more.</p>\n<p>Analysis of the repertoire of the T cells in the successful ACT treatments of three melanoma patients through exomic sequencing of tumors established a correlation between the ability of infused T cells to recognize specific mutated proteins present in tumors. Candidate mutated epitopes were identified using major histocompatibility complex-binding algorithm for recognition by TILs (Robbins et al., 2013). In one patient successfully treated by ACT in a previous trial, the specific T cells recognizing a mutated epitope persisted in peripheral blood for over 5 years [28]</p>\n<p>A recent phase II clinical trial reported objective clinical responses in almost half of the 31 patients enrolled, with two complete remission and a significant increase in PFS [29]. The study also analyzed characteristic of infused T cells associated with significant responses, and found significant correlations with: higher number of TIL infused, a higher proportion of CD8(+) T cells in the infusion product, a more differentiated effector phenotype of the CD8(+) population, and, unexpectedly, a higher frequency of CD8(+) T cells coexpressing the negative costimulation molecule \"B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator\" (BTLA). A phase I/II trial investigates autologous TILs enriched for CD8 and engineered to express IL-12 which will be infused after patients undergo myeloablative regimen of chemotherapy (NCT 01236573). On the other hand, a randomized trial suggested that use of unselected young autologous T cells is preferable to enrichment for CD8+ cells because the latter are more laborious to prepare and did not offer a therapeutic advantage[30]. A detailed analyses of the functional activity and dynamics of the infused genetically engineered T cells in patients highlighted the need to develop approaches to maintaining antitumor T-cell functionality [31]</p>\n<p>Failure of the infused CD8 cells to persist in the patients could be a major cause for the limited efficacy of TIL approaches to treatment. In a number of trials this was addressed by administration of IL2 after perfusion, or lymphodepletion prior to perfusion and IL2 after perfusion. To increase the persistence of infused T cells in patients, an approach was tested to stimulate CD8+ cells in vitro with MART-1 presenting APCs in presence of IL2 and IL15. These CTLs displayed a memory phenotype, both central and effector, trafficked successfully to the tumor sites, and produced a complete response in one of nine patients, as well as several partial responses and disease stabilization [32].</p>\n<p>Another approach to TIL therapy is to equip infused T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) to the tumor-associated antigens. CAR-modified T cells do not depend on MHC mediated antigen presentation which is frecuently dysfunctional in tumors. An excellent review outlining the steps and considerations for the production of T cells with CARs and their advantages as well as pitfalls was published recently [33]. In melanoma, T cells redirected to recognize MART-1 have produced significant clinical responses (reviewed in [34].</p>\n<p>Some remarkable responses were observed in individual patients treated with CD4+T cells. For example, autologous transfer of expanded CD4+ T cells recognizing melanoma antigen NY-ESO-1 produced a complete and durable response in one patient trial [35]. Recent findings indicate that CD4+ T cells could also contribute to the success of ACT by inducing tumor senescence through production of high levels of IFN-g and TNF [36].</p>\n<h4>Dendritic cell based immunotherapy/vaccination.</h4>\n<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen presenting cells in the immune system, and the clinical efforts to use DCsto induce potent anti-melanoma immune responses wereongoing for at least a decade [37] . However, as with most immunotherapies, the responses to DC-mediated vaccination have been unpredictable and variable.</p>\n<p>Stimulation of anti-melanoma response by DCs involves a number of steps that need better scientific understanding and clinical exploration. To arm DCs with the antigens needed to be presented to immune effector cells, DC are usually \u201cloaded\u201d with antigens expressed in tumors by incubation with the tumor antigens and an adjuvant ex vivo. This process induces maturation of DCs, which involves processing the antigens via proteasomal degradation and presentation through MHC molecules of different classes to T cells. Upon interaction with DCs, naive T cells could mature into CD4+ helper cells or CD8+ killer cells.The T helper cells could stimulate B cell based humoral responses, and killer T cells could have direct cytotoxic activity against antigen presenting tumor cells. DCs could also stimulate the components of innate immune system such as natural killer (NK) cells and phagocytes. However, DCs could induce generation of Tregs, regulatory cells that dampen immune responses. Various cytokines are involved in the process of DCs maturation, and tumors, where DCs are frequently found, might secrete cytokines that inhibit DCs maturation.</p>\n<p>A number of variables remain to be fully explored in DC vaccination: the source of DCs, the optimal methods for maturation ex vivo, the route of introduction into patients, the ways to overcome the tumor-generated immunosuppressory activities and more.</p>\n<p>Clinical trials explored DCs generated by different methods and injected by different routes in patients with metastatic melanoma (only a few are mentioned here). DCs could be isolated from peripheral bloodandfrom Langerhans cells \u2013 a subset of DC present in skin, or other sources (see below).For example, an early clinical trial that concluded in 1998 produced promising results. Patients were vaccinated with monocyte-derived DCspulsed with tumor lysate or a mix of tumor-related peptides, and stimulated with GM-CSF and IL-4. Five of 16 patients had objective responses [38] . Monocyte-derived DCs were pulsed with a single tumor peptide from Mage-3A1 and a recall antigen in another study. Evaluation of immune responses showed that 8 of 11 patients had an expansion of Mage-3A1 recognizing CD8+ T cells, of which 6 patients showed regression of some metastases [39]. It was noted that non-regressing tumors lacked Mage-3A1 expression and specific T cells.</p>\n<p>In a different approach, immature DCs were generated from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells through stimulation with a pre-defined cytokine cocktail, and matured in vitroby pulsing with a pool of peptides derived from known melanoma antigens [40]. This study reported durable immune responses and significant clinical responses as well.</p>\n<p>Langerhans cells were directly compared to monocyte-derived DCs in a clinical trial, and were found to be similar in terms of eliciting immune responses, but different in terms of the need for cytokine stimulation [41]. The role of the route of injection was explored in a study that injected monocyte-derived stimulated DCs either intranodally or intradermally. The latter produced very low percentages of cells surviving and migrating to lymph nodes [42] , but the induced immune responses (stimulation of tumor-specific T cells)were superior in the patients receiving intradermal inoculation [43] .</p>\n<p>Stimulation of DCs could be performed not only by exposing them to tumor antigens, but also by transfection of mRNA coding for the antigens [44] . The latter might have an advantage of longer exposure and correct processing of the antigens. Indeed, it was shown to produce strong immune responses after intranodal injection, inducing a broad repertoire of IFN\u03b3 producing TAA-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell [45] . Stage III melanoma patients in this study also had significant clinical responses.</p>\n<p>A recent study reported a further significant improvement on DC maturation ex vivo. Mature DCs (used for vaccination) express a specific type of proteasomes, named immunoproteasomes (iPs) that are responsible for antigen processing in immune cells. However, tumor cells express constitutive proteasomes (cPS) that contain three different subunits. A possibility was considered that this proteasome mismatch could prevent optimal recognition of tumor cells by DCs. Therefore, the patient derived DCs were transfected not only with the RNA for tumor antigens, but also with shRNA to the iPs specific subunits, enforcing expression of cPs, or with control siRNAs. Patients vaccinated with cPs-expressing DCs had lower levels of circulating melanoma cells and enhanced melanoma-directed T cell lytic activity, which was of a longer duration compared to patients in control arms of the study. Of the five patients vaccinated with cPs-expressing DCs, one had a complete response, and one had a partial response.[46]</p>\n<p>Another important component of successful vaccination with DC is their ability to stimulate CD8+ T cells which requires production of IL12-p70 by DCs, which, in turn, depends on stimulation of DCs by two signals: CD40 or TLR and INF-g. A recent small clinical trial used DCs from PBMC of melanoma patients pulsed with gp100 peptides. In addition, maturation in vitro included stimulation of DCs from PBMC with both CD40L and INF-g. The study of seven patients showed a straightforward correlation between the clinical responses and levels of IL12 produced by their DCs. The one patient with complete remission had the highest levels of IL12. Moreover, the study has identified the deficiency in non-responding patients as the inability to produce IL12 without additional stimulation with TLR agonist. Addition of poly I:C to the maturation protocol has rescued production of IL12 by these DCs and improved the clinical outcomes [47] .</p>\n<p>Combination immunotherapies involving dendritic cells and immunomodulatory antibodies hold significant promise, as seen from the results of trial of DCs pulsed with MART-1 and anti-CTLA4 antibody tremelimumab [48].</p>\n<h4>Adoptive transfer of natural killer cells</h4>\n<p>Natural killer (NK) cells are an essential part of innate immune system and have been considered in immunotherapies of melanoma. NK cells in principle are able to recognize and destroy infected or cancer cells without a need for antigenic stimulation. However, their activity, as with other immune effector cells, also depends on balance of stimulatory or inhibitory factors. NK cells themselves express negative regulatory receptors, one of which, KIR (killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors), is targeted in a clinical trial with the antagonistic antibody BMS-986015 that is designed to block the inhibitory function of KIR.</p>\n<p>NK cells could be relatively easily isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)where they comprise 5-15 % of the lymphocyte population. Several attempts to transfer expanded and activated autologous NK cells in melanoma patients have not resulted in a clinical benefit probably because of the inhibitory signals delivered to these cells by the tumor or peripheral microenvironment [49] . New strategies might include combination of NK transfer with immunomodulatory antibodies or even transfer of activated allogeneic NK cells[50] ).The cytokine induced killer cells (CIK) which could also be isolated from PBMC were recently characterized as a new NK subtype that have a cytotoxic activity against autologous melanoma cells [51]</p>\n<h3>Influence of targeted therapies on the responses to immune therapy</h3>\n<h4>BRAF/MAPK signaling and TIL.</h4>\n<p>Activated BRAF/MAPK signaling was shown to be essential in the development of immune evasion in melanoma [52]. Prior to clinical development of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, it was shown that inhibition of the MAPK pathway leads to increased expression of melanocytic antigen expression, including MART-1, gp100, and tyrosinase; whereas enforced expression of mutant RAF downregulated expression of these antigens [53]. Mutant BRAF induces expression of IL1a in stroma, also leading to immune suppression [54]. In a mouse model, BRAFV600E induced expression of Ccl2, an immunosuppressive cytokine, while PLX4720 treatment downregulated tumor Ccl2 gene expression and increased numbers of CD8 TILs [55].</p>\n<p>There were concerns that treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors might have a direct inhibitory effect on T cell function and it was indeed shown later that treatment with MEK inhibitors, but not BRAFV600E inhibitors, impairs T lymphocyte function [56].</p>\n<p>A number of subsequent reports have confirmed that inhibition of mutant BRAF could potentiate immune responses in melanoma, suggesting that blockade of immune checkpoints in combination of BRAF inhibitors could have a great clinical value. Treatment with BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib resulted in markedly increased numbers of TIL (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) in tumor biopsies obtained pre- and post-treatment in 15 patients [57]. Another study found that dabrafenib has no detectable negative impact on existing systemic immunity or the de novo generation of tumor-specific T cells in patients [58].</p>\n<p>A single report claimed that selective BRAF inhibition decreases tumor-resident lymphocyte frequencies in a mouse melanoma model; moreover, treatment with ipilimumab has not restored the numbers of TIL [59].</p>\n<p>The latest reported analysis of biopsies taken before and after treatment with BRAF or BRAF+MEK inhibitors showed the following: enhancement of melanoma antigen expression, increase in CD8+ TILs, and decrease in immunosuppressive cytokines IL6 and IL8. Interestingly, inhibitory PD-1 was increased on T cells and its immunosuppressive ligand PDL1 was also increased with BRAF inhibition. This supports the hypothesis that targeting inhibitory immune interactions may be critical in augmenting responses to BRAF-targeted therapy in patients with melanoma [60].</p>\n<h4>Adoptive cell transfer therapy and targeted therapies.</h4>\n<p>Adoptive cell transfer therapy could also be of more benefit when combined with vemurafenib, as a mouse model suggests [61]. In a recent study, vemurafenib increased MAPK signaling, in vivo cytotoxic activity, and intratumoral cytokine secretion by adoptively transferred cells (T cells genetically engineered to recognize tumor-expressing antigens). Another study reported that administration of PLX4720 significantly increased tumor infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells in vivo and enhanced their antitumor activity in a mouse model. Apparently, PLX4720 negatively affected expression of VEGF by tumor cells. Importantly, analysis of human melanoma biopsies before and during BRAF inhibitor treatment also showed downregulation of VEGF consistent with the preclinical murine model [62].</p>\n<p>An in vitro study analyzed effects of BRAF and MEK inhibition on function of dendritic cells (DC) in vitro and found that BRAF-mutant melanomas suppress immune function of dendritic cells. Inhibition of BRAF, but not MEK could reverse suppression of DC function. As has been reported for the effects of MEK inhibition on T cells [63], inhibition of MEK did negatively affect DC function and viability. Vemurafenib, but not MEK inhibitors, was therefore suggested as a preferable candidate for combination immunotherapy approaches in BRAF-mutant melanoma. [64].</p>\n<p>Another in vitro study examined how vemurafenib affects the ability of the clinical grade tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to recognize autologous BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro [65]. The results showed a significant increase in recognition of the inhibitor-treated melanoma cells that was attributed to increased expression of MHC class I-associated proteins and heat-shock proteins.</p>\n<p>These studies in general provide a strong rationale for combination therapies involving BRAF inhibition with immunotherapies involving either antibodies to immunosuppressive molecules or adoptive cell transfer. Several trials are ongoing, but one of them had to be discontinued. The phase I trial (NCT01400451) of concurrent vemurafenib and ipilimumab was closed in March 2013, due to doze-limiting liver toxicities [66]. This highlights the need for careful evaluation of combination strategies, in particular because the drugs in this trial were approved, and had little overlap in terms of side effects. Other trials will evaluate combinations of vemurafenib and anti-PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280A (NCT01656642), vemurafenib and HD-IL2 (NCT01683188), vemurafenib and adoptive cell transfer (NCT01585415), and HD-IL2 + adoptive cell transfer + vemurafenib (NCT01659151) and more. Sequencing of BRAF inhibition and ipilimumab treatments present a serious clinical problem for patients who experience rapid disease progression on BRAF inhibitors [67].</p>\n<p>Mutant BRAF and/or its inhibition are not expected to influence outcomes of all immune therapies. For example, a recent trial showed that treatment with IL21 produced an overall response rate of 22.5% in melanoma and responses were not related to the status of BRAF [68]. Treatment with high-dose IL-2 was more effective in patients in patients with NRAS mutations versus BRAF mutations on WT/WT tumors [69].</p>\n<p>Other melanoma-related pathways might also play a role in responses to immune therapy. Wnt/b-catenin signaling might be involved in immunosuppression in melanoma, as high levels of nuclear b-catenin in melanoma cells impaired maturation of DCs at least in part through increased production of IL-10 and inhibited IFN-g production by melanoma-specific CTLs [70]. It is entirely possible and even likely that other oncogenic pathways in melanoma also mediate immune suppression in melanoma.</p>\n<h4>Tumor microenvironment and immune responses.</h4>\n<p><strong>The role of B cells in the immune responses in melanoma.</strong> IgG producing B cells have been reported in melanoma, but their functional significance was largely unknown. A study published in March of 2013 found a skewing of B cell repertoire in melanoma tumors, with highly increased numbers of IgG4 producing B cells relative to normal ratios. High IgG4/IgGtotal ratios are considered a limiting response by the immune system to contain immune activation. In melanoma, production of B cells secreting inhibitory IgG4, is stimulated by the tumor secreted IL-10 and IL-4. The tumor-specific IgG4 even inhibited IgG1-dependent tumor cell killing through engagement of the Fc\u03b3RI effector mechanisms. Moreover, high circulating levels of IgG4 in serum of patients were associated with poor prognosis[71]</p>\n<p>An extensive study measured humoral B cell responses in melanoma patients, concluding that melanoma patients, on average, have highly increased antibody responses against melanoma cells compared to healthy volunteeres. Interestingly, the B cell mediated immune responses were significantly diminished in patients with metastatic melanoma versus primary disease [72] . The impaired B cell functionality with loss of CD27+ (memory) cells was previously reported in metastatic melanoma [73]</p>\n<p><strong>Immune cell infiltrates in melanoma.</strong> The presence of lymph node-like structures in solid tumors has been recognized relatively recently, and is considered to have a prognostic value, in particular as related to immune therapy [74]. It was suggested that the presence of these lymphoid structures could be due to locally tumor-produced chemokines, and might be useful in selection of patients for whom immunotherapies might work best. Moreover, a particular 12 chemokine signature produced by tumors, was identified by expression profiling, and was shown to be predictive of the formation of these lymph node-like structures. The hope is that this expression signature might be used for selection of patients for whom long-lasting responses to immunotherapy are possible [75].</p>\n<h2 id=\"erh-0f5e2289-dc09-416c-a765-08e5a02e2dd0\">Metabolism and Autophagy as Targets in Melanoma Therapy</h2>\n<p>There have been few attempts to target melanoma metabolism with the exception of several known metabolic preferences listed below. However, recent discoveries, such as high levels of OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation) in highly aggressive melanoma mediated by elevated expression of PGC-1a [1] [2]might prompt more interest in targeting melanoma metabolism. For many years, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were used as a predictive factor to identify melanoma patients with worsened prognosis, and they presumably are indicative of the high glycolytic character of tumors, though the energy requirements of melanoma might be fulfilled through a more complex relationship between glycolysis and OXPHOS [3]. An OXPHOS inhibitor elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel was clinically tested in a randomized trial in unselected patients. The study was terminated due to increased death in patients with high LDH receiving paclitaxel alone [4]. However, the study also revealed a statistically significant increase in PFS in patients with normal serum levels of LDH receiving elesclomol, that is, a group of patients with tumors that rely on OXPHOS.</p>\n<p>Regarding the possible effects of metabolic preferences of melanoma tumors on the efficacy of targeted therapy, it is of interest that mutant BRAF inhibition might be more efficacious in tumors with higher glycolytic index [5] [6]. As mentioned above, this metabolic trait could be useful as a predictive marker of response to BRAF inhibition. In addition, inhibition of BRAF(V600E) appears to induce a switch from glycolytic to OXPHOS metabolism, via induction of MITF, followed by MITF's induction of PGCa [7]. A consequence of this shift was an apparent dependency of BRAF-inhibited cells upon OXPHOS metabolism, thus suggesting new BRAF-combination strategies for patients.</p>\n<p>The importance of OXPHOS in melanoma resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy with Vemurafenibwas highlighted in another study that aimed to explore the significance of a subpolulation of melanoma cells expressingH3K4 demethylase JARID1B. JARID1B melanoma cells cycle slowly, but can produce progeny of fast-dividing cells without having other hallmarks of stem cells [8]. Deeper analysis of these cells revealed that JARID1B positivity is associated with the post-treatment surviving fraction, and is marked by increased levels of OXPHOS which presumably contributes to their survival [9]. These resistant cells could be successfully targeted by inhibitors of OXPHOS such as phenformin, similar to findings in the study described above on MITF induction of PGCa.</p>\n<p>A most interesting study implicated enzyme PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) that links glycolysis to OXPHOS in the abrogation of mutant BRAF induced senescence (OIS). Oxygen consumption was increased in senescent cells modified to express mutant BRAF, which was mediated by activated PDH. Two key PDH regulating enzymes were involved in the observed activation of PDH: inhibitory PDK1 was suppressed, while activating PDP2 was upregulated. Ectopic expression of PDK1 was able to overcome BRAF induced senescence of melanocytes and promote robust tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PDK1 depletion in melanoma tumors dramatically increased their sensitivity to vemurafenib in vivo by eliminating subpopulation of cells resistance to the drug [10]. These results established a direct role for metabolic axis in the development and drug resistance of melanomas.</p>\n<p>The role of autophagy in tumor development and responses to various treatments remains controversial, most likely due to the fact that autophagy can contribute either to death or survival of cancer cells depending on the nature of the death signal and cellular context. Deprivation of amino acids is considered to be of potential benefit in melanoma treatment due to specific metabolic preferences/dependency of melanoma tumors, but induction of \"starvation-induced\" autophagy could be detrimental.</p>\n<p>Arginine deprivation. Melanoma tumors, along with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and prostate cancer, frequently show deficiency of the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) [11], cannot synthesize arginine from citrulline, and depend on exogenous arginine for survival. Arginine degradation using arginine deiminase (ADI) leads to growth inhibition and eventually cell death, while normal cells that express ASS can survive (reviewed in [12]). Pegylated ADI (ADI-PEG20) has shown antitumor activity in melanoma [183]. Another arginine degrading enzyme, arginase, in a recombinant pegylated and cobalt-substituted form, Co-ArgI-PEG, is being developed for clinical trials. It is already clear that treatment with ADI-PEG20 induces resistance in patients by at least two identified mechanisms: induction of protective autophagy and reexpression of ASS and activation of the MAPK pathway (reviewed in Yoon, et al, 2013 [13]). If arginine deprivation therapy with arginine-degrading enzymes is to become a valid therapeutic option, concurrent therapies targeting autophagy or the MAPK pathway should be considered.</p>\n<p>Leucine deprivation. Leucine deprivation was also shown to induce apoptotic death in melanoma cells; moreover, the dependence of melanoma cells on leucine was functionally linked to the activated RAS-MAPK pathway, in particular BRAFV600E mutation. The latter rendered the mTOR pathway resistant to leucine deprivation, but inhibition of autophagy was able to restore sensitivity of these cells to leucine deprivation. Dietary leucine deprivation combined with an inhibitor of autophagy suppressed melanoma xenograft growth in vivo [14].</p>\n<p>Autophagy is a potential target in melanoma. However, drug-induced autophagy could be either suicidal or protective, which is reflected in the ongoing clinical studies. Metformin was shown to induce suicidal autophagy in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo (Tomic et al., 2011). Metformin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, activates AMPK as a result of decreased AMP/ATP ratio, and inhibits mTOR. Long known for its antihyperglycemic properties, it is being explored for antineoplastic activities. A trial of metformin with vemurafenib is ongoing (NCT01638676). On the other hand, the old antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, an inhibitor of autophagy, is also trialed with vemurafenib (NCT01897116).</p>\n<p>Because autophagy is known to be involved in both innate and adaptive immunity, there is an interest in exploring manipulation of autophagy for immunotherapy. Autophagy was reported to enhance antigen presentation by dendritic cells, therefore potentiating T cell activation, and could be enhanced by nanoparticle-based antigen presentation [15]; autophagosome preparations enriched for tumor antigens were used to pulse dendritic cells for successful vaccination of tumor-bearing mice [16]. On the other hand, inhibition of autophagy was shown to promote antitumor responses to systemic IL-2 immunotherapy [17] ; [18]. Apparently, the specific roles of autophagy in different immune responses would have to be explored individually.</p>\n<h2 id=\"erh-28885bab-ac29-4835-a3ad-2bfa2803e7dc\">New Prognostic Markers</h2>\n<h3>Circulating Melanoma Cells</h3>\n<p>Detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in melanoma was explored for at least last twenty years. CTC have been shown to serve as seeds for metastatic lesions, and therefore their presence could be interpreted as a prognostic marker. In addition, monitoring of CTC levels could serve as a marker of disease progression and treatment success or failure (reviewed in([1]; [2]). Molecular profiling of CTC could become a \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d, and could reflect genetic heterogeneity, both intratumoral or between multiple metastatic tumors.</p>\n<p>The earlier attempts were directed mostly towards developing a multimarker RT-PCR to detect and monitor the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in the bloodstream. The first detection of melanoma CTC was based on RT-PCR of tyrosinase [3]. Numerous studies have employed RT-PCR of a variety of melanoma markers to analyze peripheral blood preparations and examine prognostic significance of these assays. For example, a serial analysis of two melanoma-associated markers (tyrosinase and MART-1) was shown to be an independent predictor of disease recurrence for stage IV melanoma patients after surgery and adjuvant therapy [4].A study that performed serial analysis of CTC using a five-marker RT-PCR (MART-1, GalNAc-T, PAX-3, MITF and MAGE-A3) concluded that it could be useful for prognostic purposes [5]. CTC assessment with three markers - MART-1, MAGE-A3, and PAX3 - provided prognostic discrimination before and during adjuvant treatment for resected stage IV melanoma patients [6].Similarly, a stage III clinical trial found that positivity for at least two out of three CTC biomarkers (MART-1, GalNAc-T and MAGE-A3) examined was significantly associated with decreased recurrence-free survival in patients with stage II melanoma and metastases to sentinel lymph nodes [7]. These CTC markers were deemed to be useful in selecting patients for aggressive adjuvant treatments. A different set of CTC markers (MLANA, ABCB5, TGFbeta2, PAX3d and MCAM) was examined, and two of them (MLANA and ABCB5) were also foundto be useful in predicting disease status [8]. At the same time, analysis of cytokine receptors expression in CTC had no predictive significance for treatment outcomes [9], possibly due to thechoice markers. Overall, the many studies performed indicate that a validated set of CTC biomarkers as well as standardized methodology is necessary to make RT-PCR analysis of CTC a useful tool in assessment of melanoma prognosis.For now, RT-PCR of peripheral blood is not considered to be highly promising.</p>\n<p>A different approach involves physical separation of CTC prior to their analyses. This methodology is somewhat limited by its most often used approach, which relies on expression of certain surface proteins on circulating tumor cells for their identification and separation. CellSearchVeridex technology, widely used for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in blood was designed for breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancer, which express EpCAM markers. Continuing expression of these proteins on CTC could not be counted upon when de-differentiation (such as epithelial to mesenchyme transition in epithelial cancers)occurs during tumor progression. Nevertheless, use of CellSearch platform was reported to detect CTC in 40% of patients with advanced melanoma, and the numbers of CTC were prognostic in themselves for overall survival and reflect treatments\u2019 outcomes [10]. The CellSearchVeridex platform was recently adapted for melanoma markers, and was reported to be successful in detection and quantification of CTC in cerebrospinal fluid in two melanoma patients with leptomeningial metastases [11]New techniques are being developed, such as isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells (ISET) which was able to detect CTC in 29% of patients with primary invasive melanoma and in 62.5% of metastatic melanoma patients, with an excellent correlation for detection of CTC by RT-PCR of tyrosinase [12].Results obtained with ISET should be, however, considered carefully, because circulating melanocytes were detected in blood of a patient with a untypical melanocytic lesion [13]. A new technique named photoacoustic blood cancer testing was successfully applied to melanoma CTC in mice and spiked human blood and could be used to capture CTC ([14]; [15]).A recent report described a method to detect and isolate single circulating melanoma cells that integrates a polymer-nanofiber-embedded nanovelcro cell-affinity assay with a laser microdissection (LMD) technique. This method not only separates melanoma CTC from peripheral blood, but also allows sequencing of individual cells for specific mutations [16].</p>\n<p>The inertial focusing-enhanced microfluidic CTC capture platform, termed \"CTC-iChip\" is capable of rapid sorting of rare CTCs from whole blood. The iChip technology is capable of isolating CTCs using strategies that involve recognition of extracellular epitopes, but could be used independently of tumor-specific membrane protein recognition [17]. The methodology was successfully tested in epithelial cancer and melanoma, and enables RNA profiling of single cells. Isolation of CTC using the ScreenCell filtration technique with quantitative analysis of CTC telomeres by TeloView was described recently [18]. Molecular profiling of CTC might provide a very valuable representation of a tumor(s) genotype because CTCpresumably reflect tumor heterogeneity better than a single tumor biopsy. Indeed, several studies have discovered discordant mutations in CTC versus biopsies. Inconsistencies of BRAF and KIT mutations between tumor biopsies and CTC were described[19]; [20]. Presumably, CTCs also represent tumor cells with higher metastatic potential, and thus could be more relevant to the molecular profiling of aggressive tumor variants or metastases.</p>\n<p>Several clinical trials are ongoing that incorporate CTC detection and analyses prior to and after treatments to investigate the prognostic value of CTC. The CellSearchVeridex technique will be evaluated in terms of its predictive and prognostic ability (NCT01573494). CellSearch and Epispot (another platform based on immunomagnetic separation) are compared in NCT01558349. Trial NCT01528774 addresses the possibility of long term culture of melanoma CTCs isolated using TrueCells technology. A future trial NCT01776905 will evaluate use of photoacoustic flow cytometry for in vivo, real time detection of CTC.Treatment with ipilimumab and sterotactic ablative radiation therapy (NCT01565837) or with Sargamostim/GM-CSF will include analysis of CTC as a predictive/prognostic markers (NCT01489423). Multiple parameters including CTC are evaluated in an ongoing trial of Imatininb (NCT00470470).</p>\n<p>Recent studies have addressed the utility of yet another method of \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d, i.e. analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by NGS techniques rather than RT-PCR of defined biomarkers. A side-by-side comparison was performed of the analyses for a serum biomarker versus analysis of CTC versus analysis of ctDNA by targeted or whole genomic sequence in breast cancer patients. This study reported the superiority of ctDNA analysis, as having a greater dynamic range, a greater correlation with changes in tumor burden, and better measure of treatment response [21]. The next publication from the same group reported monitoring of ctDNA by exomic sequencing in breast cancer patients prior to and during treatments [22]. Serial analysis of ctDNA had successfully detected a number of prognostic genomic alterations that were either increased or appeared de novo as a consequence of treatments. It remains to be seen if detection of ctDNA will be a useful prognostic companion or even a substitute for tumor biopsies.</p>\n<h3>Prognostic Test of Uveal Melanoma</h3>\n<p>Uveal melanoma is a distinct type of melanoma with a clinical course and molecular landscape of its own. Even though patients rarely present with metastatic disease and are routinely subjected to surgery with curative intent, almost half have a high risk disease that requires careful monitoring and/or adjuvant therapy after tumor resection. It has been difficult to stratify patients into high- versus low risk of metastatic disease based on clinicopathological findings only.</p>\n<p>DecisionDx-UM gene expression profile test was developed as a stand-alone platform which requires no other information for prognostic accuracy. The test is PCR-based andmeasures the expression of 12selected genes from primary uveal melanoma samples obtained by fine needle biopsy. The test allows patients to be stratified into risk categories such that high-risk patients can be offered intensive metastatic surveillance and adjuvant therapy while low-risk patients can be spared unnecessary chemotherapy and frequent monitoring [23].</p>\n<h3>Exosomes</h3>\n<p>Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with an endosome origin that are released by cells into the extracellular environment. They could fuse with other cells thereby transferring the RNAs and proteins they carry. Tumor-derived exosomes are emerging mediators of tumorigenesis; there is a growing interest in exploring treatment options targeting exosomes. Exosomes are thought to participate in the formation of pre-metastatic niche, i.e. specific microenvironment that is re-programmed to support survival and growth of metastatic cells. There has been significant interest in exploring the role of exosomes as prognostic markers (reviewed in[24]). A recent exciting study analyzed exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas. It found that these \"metastatic\" exosomes increased the invasive behavior of primary tumors by permanently \"educating\" bone marrow progenitors through the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also induced vascular leakiness at premetastatic sites and reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype. Reducing MET expression in exosomes diminished the prometastatic behavior of bone marrow cells. Notably, MET expression was elevated in circulating bone marrow progenitors from individuals with metastatic melanoma. The study identified an exosome-specific melanoma signature with prognostic and therapeutic potential comprised of TYRP2, VLA-4, HSP70 (HSP90) isoform, and the MET oncoprotein [25].</p>\n<h2 id=\"erh-53aa28d4-b7dd-4c6f-8cb8-4319dc2acc9d\">Concluding Remarks</h2>\n<p>It is very likely, considering the most recent findings, that the majority of driver mutations in melanoma have been identified. The study most quoted in this paper[1] reported that, outside of the most frequent mutations in BRAF and NRAS, driver mutations were identified in 83% of remaining BRAF and NRAS wild-type tumors. These results will be confirmed in much larger cohorts of melanoma tumors; some changes (identification of new rare driver or helper mutations) could be anticipated.</p>\n<p>However, the accumulated knowledge is already sufficient to concentrate on the biological significance of genetic aberrations identified in melanoma and to evaluate their suitability as targets. Combination therapies are obviously the way of the future and might include two or more targeted therapies in combination with immunotherapies. One can also envision combinations that include novel therapies that target basic processes (eg, metabolism, autophagy) that are sufficiently deranged in melanoma compared to normal cells.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n", "publication_link": "http://www.example.com/", "revision_date": "2013-08-15T22:17:34Z", "publication_date": "2013-08-13T22:49:50Z", "title": "Evidence Review of Melanoma"}}, {"pk": "erh-027b576c-23d6-4124-80af-058df401e802", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 5, "paper": 3, "header_text": "Immunotherapy"}}, {"pk": "erh-0f5e2289-dc09-416c-a765-08e5a02e2dd0", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 6, "paper": 3, "header_text": "Metabolism and Autophagy as Targets in Melanoma Therapy"}}, {"pk": "erh-1185313b-8376-46eb-81e4-e4b91afaff40", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 1, "paper": 3, "header_text": "Molecular subtypes"}}, {"pk": "erh-28885bab-ac29-4835-a3ad-2bfa2803e7dc", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 7, "paper": 3, "header_text": "New Prognostic Markers"}}, {"pk": "erh-2b894094-daba-4094-a7e9-6877370a1172", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 0, "paper": 3, "header_text": "Introduction"}}, {"pk": "erh-3982c4a6-311a-4ac4-a574-1f2017eea49c", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 2, "paper": 3, "header_text": "Intrinsic Resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors"}}, {"pk": "erh-40a998df-4570-41ba-8be7-4b44ee1eac04", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 3, "paper": 3, "header_text": "Acquired Resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors"}}, {"pk": "erh-53aa28d4-b7dd-4c6f-8cb8-4319dc2acc9d", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 8, "paper": 3, "header_text": "Concluding Remarks"}}, {"pk": "erh-79fd0a5e-9048-46a1-8f8a-6401b1361034", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 2, "paper": 1, "header_text": "section 3"}}, {"pk": "erh-b43b5566-41ca-4fcb-ab77-f1417a7b6fde", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 0, "paper": 1, "header_text": "section 1"}}, {"pk": "erh-baaeeb7b-5ae6-41f6-9d68-c23d98405921", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 4, "paper": 3, "header_text": "Combinational Therapies"}}, {"pk": "erh-f3f792ea-f8dc-47d5-8d38-2737420c85e8", "model": "er.papersection", "fields": {"position": 1, "paper": 1, "header_text": "section foo"}}]
